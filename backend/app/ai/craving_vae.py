"""
Craving-Signature VAE
======================
This is the ONE model in the backend that's actually trained end-to-end
right now (see the note at the bottom of this file for why this one was
picked over the others described in the report).

What it replaces: the old `rank_swaps()` in main.py scored candidates by
literal tag-string overlap between the query and each swap item — not
learned, not really "deep learning," just set intersection.

What this does instead:
  1. Each swap candidate is described by a small structured
     "craving-signature" vector — continuous scores (0-1) across sensory
     axes: sweet, salty, crunchy, fizzy, creamy, fruity, cold, savory.
  2. A tiny VAE (numpy, no torch/tensorflow dependency — deliberately
     lightweight so it trains in under a second on this laptop-class
     dataset and has zero extra install burden) is trained to encode
     those vectors into a low-dimensional latent space and reconstruct
     them.
  3. At inference time, both a user's craving text and every candidate
     item are mapped into that learned latent space, and ranking is done
     by distance in the *learned* space rather than raw tag overlap.

Honesty note: this is a genuinely trained generative model (encoder,
reparameterization trick, decoder, reconstruction + KL loss, gradient
descent), but the dataset is small and hand-authored (12 items), so treat
the *ranking quality* as illustrative of the technique, not as a validated
recommendation engine. The report should describe it exactly this way.

# Why this model and not YOLO/CNN-OCR/attention-captioner/BiLSTM/GAN:
#
# The report (Positioning of SafeBite-DL section) already identifies the
# craving-signature VAE as the one piece of the pipeline that's genuinely
# unclaimed in the competitive landscape — the allergen-matching half is a
# mature, well-served category, but no competitor grounds swap
# recommendations in a learned embedding over structured sensory
# attributes. That makes it the highest-value thing to actually finish
# training for a review, versus spending the same hours getting a YOLO
# panel detector or a CNN/CRNN OCR model to a *usable* accuracy on a
# from-scratch photographed-label dataset that doesn't exist yet.
#
# Everything else described in the report (YOLO panel detection,
# CNN/CRNN OCR, attention-based captioner, BiLSTM next-flag predictor,
# conditional GAN for label augmentation) should be presented as
# architected — with a defined input/output shape, a named evaluation
# metric, and a place in the pipeline — but NOT YET TRAINED. Say that
# plainly in the report rather than letting the prose imply they're all
# live. A reviewer who asks "show me the OCR model's confusion matrix"
# should get "that one's architected, here's the plan and here's why it
# wasn't feasible to train in this pass" — not silence or a bluff.
